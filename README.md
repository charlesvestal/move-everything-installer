# Move Everything Installer

Desktop app for installing [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-anything) on your Ableton Move.

## Requirements

- **Ableton Move** connected to the same WiFi network as your computer
- **macOS**, **Windows**, or **Linux**

### Windows Users: Git for Windows Required

The installer needs [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to run the installation scripts. **Install it before running the installer.** The default installation options are fine — the installer only needs the Git Bash component that comes bundled with it.

## Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything-installer/releases):

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Move Everything Installer-*-mac-arm64.zip` |
| macOS (Intel) | `Move Everything Installer-*-mac-x64.zip` |
| Windows (x64) | `Move Everything Installer-*-win-x64.exe` |
| Windows (ARM64) | `Move Everything Installer-*-win-arm64.exe` |
| Linux (x64) | `Move Everything Installer-*-linux-x64.deb` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `Move Everything Installer-*-linux-arm64.deb` |

## First-Time Setup

1. **Launch the installer** and accept the community-software disclaimer
2. **Connect to your Move** — the installer automatically finds it on your network. If auto-discovery fails, you can enter the IP address manually
3. **Enter the 6-digit code** shown on your Move's display
4. **Add SSH key** — the installer generates a secure key and sends it to your Move. Confirm by selecting "Yes" on Move's jog wheel
5. **Choose what to install** — select the core framework and any modules you want
6. **Wait for installation** — progress is shown as files are transferred to your Move

On subsequent runs, the installer remembers your device and skips the authentication steps.

## Managing Your Installation

When Move Everything is already installed, the installer switches to management mode:

- **Install New Modules** — browse and install additional sound generators, effects, and utilities
- **Upgrade Core** — update to the latest version when available
- **Screen Reader** — toggle text-to-speech accessibility
- **Uninstall** — remove Move Everything and restore stock firmware

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- Make sure Move is powered on and connected to the same WiFi network
- Try opening `http://move.local` in your browser to verify connectivity
- **Windows**: Make sure your network is set to "Private" (mDNS doesn't work on "Public" networks)
- Use manual IP entry if auto-discovery doesn't work

### Windows: "Git Bash is required" Error
- Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Restart the installer after installation
- The default Git for Windows install options work — no special configuration needed

### SSH Connection Failed
- Confirm you selected "Yes" on Move's display when prompted
- Check that no firewall is blocking port 22
- Try uninstalling and re-pairing if the issue persists after a Move firmware update

### Installation Failed
- Ensure your Move has enough free storage space
- Check your network connection is stable
- Use "Export Debug Logs" (in the footer) to save diagnostic info for reporting issues

## Debug Logs

Every screen has an "Export Debug Logs" link in the footer. If you run into problems, export the logs and include them when [reporting an issue](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything-installer/issues).
