# Move Everything Installer v0.2.15

## Summary
This release improves macOS device discovery reliability by adding explicit Local Network metadata to the app bundle.

## Changes
- Added macOS `Info.plist` keys via Electron Builder `extendInfo`:
  - `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
  - `NSBonjourServices` (`_http._tcp`, `_ssh._tcp`)
- Bumped app version to `0.2.15`.
- Normalized lockfile version metadata to `0.2.15`.

## Why this matters
- On some macOS setups, missing Local Network metadata can prevent expected permission behavior and lead to discovery failures for `move.local`.
- This update ensures the installer declares the correct network usage context at packaging time.

## Validation
- Built signed macOS artifacts for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
- Confirmed the generated app bundles include the new `Info.plist` keys.

## Upgrade notes
- If you previously denied access or had stale permission state, reset and relaunch:
  - `tccutil reset All com.move-everything.installer`
